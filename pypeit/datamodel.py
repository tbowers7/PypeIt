DataContainer
-------------

:class:`DataContainer` objects provide a utility for
enforcing a specific datamodel on an object, and provides convenience
routines for writing data to fits files. The class itself is an
abstract base class that cannot be directly instantiated. As a base
class, :class:`DataContainer` objects are versatile, but they have
their limitations.

Derived classes must do the following:

    - Define a class attribute called ``datamodel``. See the examples
      below for their format.
    - Provide an :func:`__init__` method that defines the
      instantiation calling sequence and passes the relevant
      dictionary to this base-class instantiation.
    - Provide a :func:`_validate` method, if necessary, that
      processes the data provided in the `__init__` into a complete
      instantiation of the object. This method and the
      :func:`__init__` method are the *only* places where attributes
      can be added to the class.
    - Provide a :func:`_bundle` method that reorganizes the datamodel
      into partitions that can be written to one or more fits
      extensions. More details are provided in the description of
      :func:`DataContainer._bundle`.
    - Provide a :func:`_parse` method that parses information in one
      or more fits extensions into the appropriate datamodel. More
      details are provided in the description of
      :func:`DataContainer._parse`.

.. note::

    The attributes of the class are *not required* to be a part of
    the ``datamodel``; however, it makes the object simpler when they
    are. Any attributes that are not part of the ``datamodel`` must
    be defined in either the :func:`__init__` or :func:`_validate`
    methods; otherwise, the class with throw an ``AttributeError``.

Here are some examples of how to and how not to use them.

Defining the datamodel
++++++++++++++++++++++

The format of the ``datamodel`` needed for each implementation of a
:class:`DataContainer` derived class is as follows.

The datamodel itself is a class attribute (i.e., it is a member of
the class, not just of an instance of the class). The datamodel is a
dictionary of dictionaries: Each key of the datamodel dictionary
provides the name of a given datamodel element, and the associated
item (dictionary) for the datamodel element provides the type and
description information for that datamodel element. For each
datamodel element, the dictionary item must provide:

    - ``otype``: This is the type of the object for this datamodel
      item. E.g., for a float or a `numpy.ndarray`_, you would set
      ``otype=float`` and ``otype=np.ndarray``, respectively.

    - ``descr``: This provides a text description of the datamodel
      element. This is used to construct the datamodel tables in the
      pypeit documentation.

If the object type is a `numpy.ndarray`_, you should also provide the
``atype`` keyword that sets the type of the data contained within the
array. E.g., for a floating point array containing an image, your
datamodel could be simply::

    datamodel = {'image' : dict(otype=np.ndarray, atype=float, descr='My image')}

Currently, ``datamodel`` components are restricted to have ``otype``
that are :obj:`tuple`, :obj:`int`, :obj:`float`, ``numpy.integer``,
``numpy.floating``, `numpy.ndarray`_, or `astropy.table.Table`_
objects. E.g., ``datamodel`` values for ``otype`` *cannot* be
:obj:`dict`.

More advanced examples are given below.

Basic container
+++++++++++++++

Here's how to create a derived class for a basic container that
holds two arrays and a metadata parameter::

    import numpy as np
    import inspect

    from pypeit.datamodel import DataContainer

    class BasicContainer(DataContainer):
        datamodel = {'vec1': dict(otype=np.ndarray, atype=float, descr='Test'),
                     'meta1': dict(otype=str, decr='test'),
                     'arr1': dict(otype=np.ndarray, atype=float, descr='test')}

        def __init__(self, vec1, meta1, arr1):
            # All arguments are passed directly to the container
            # instantiation
            args, _, _, values = inspect.getargvalues(inspect.currentframe())
            super(BasicContainer, self).__init__({k: values[k] for k in args[1:]}) 

        def _bundle(self):
            # Use the base class _bundle Specify the extension
            return super(BasicContainer, self)._bundle(ext='basic')

With this implementation:

    - You can instantiate the container so that number of data table
      rows would be the same (10)::

        data = BasicContainer(np.arange(10), 'length=10', np.arange(30).reshape(10,3))

    - After instantiating, access the data like this::

        # Get the data model keys
        keys = list(data.keys())

        # Access the datamodel as attributes ...
        print(data.vec1)
        # ... or as items
        print(data['meta1'])

    - Attributes and items are case-sensitive::

        # Faults because of case-sensitive attributes/items
        print(data.Vec1)
        print(data['MeTa1'])

    - The attributes of the container can only be part of the
      datamodel or added in either the :func:`DataContainer.__init__`
      or :func:`DataContainer._validate` methods::

        # Faults with KeyError
        data['newvec'] = np.arange(10)
        test = data['newvec']

        # Faults with AttributeError
        data.newvec = np.arange(10)
        test = data.newvec

    - The :class:`DataContainer` also enforces strict types for
      members of the datamodel::

        # Faults with TypeError
        data.vec1 = 3
        data.meta1 = 4.

    - Read/Write the data from/to a fits file. In this instantiation,
      the data is written to a `astropy.io.fits.BinTableHDU` object;
      the table has 10 rows because the shape of the arrays match
      this. The file I/O routines look like this::

        # Write to a file
        ofile = 'test.fits'
        data.to_file(ofile)

        # Write to a gzipped file
        ofile = 'test.fits.gz'
        data.to_file(ofile)

        # Test written data against input
        with fits.open(ofile) as hdu:
            print(len(hdu))
            # 2: The primary extension and a binary table with the data

            print(hdu[1].name)
            # BASIC: As set by the _bundle method
            
            print(len(hdu['BASIC'].data))
            # 10: The length of the data table
            
            print(hdu['BASIC'].columns.names)
            # ['vec1', 'arr1']: datamodel elements written to the table columns
            
            print(hdu['BASIC'].header['meta1'])
            # 'length=10': int, float, or string datamodel components are written to headers

    - If the shape of the first axis of the arrays (number of rows)
      do not match, the arrays are written as single elements of a
      table with one row::

        # Number of rows are mismatched 
        data = BasicContainer(np.arange(10), 'length=1', np.arange(30).reshape(3,10))
        data.to_file(ofile)

        with fits.open(ofile) as hdu:
            print(len(hdu))
            # 2: The primary extension and a binary table with the data
            print(len(hdu['BASIC'].data))
            # 1: All of the data is put into a single row

Mixed Object Containers
+++++++++++++++++++++++

:class:`DataContainer` objects can also contain multiple arrays
and/or `astropy.table.Table`_ objects. However, multiple Tables or
combinations of arrays and Tables cannot be bundled into individual
extensions. Here are two implementations of a mixed container, a good
one and a bad one::

    import numpy as np
    import inspect

    from astropy.table import Table

    from pypeit.datamodel import DataContainer

    class GoodMixedTypeContainer(DataContainer):
        datamodel = {'tab1': dict(otype=Table, descr='Test'),
                     'tab1len': dict(otype=int, descr='test'),
                     'arr1': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='test'),
                     'arr1shape': dict(otype=tuple, descr='test')}

        def __init__(self, tab1, arr1):
            # All arguments are passed directly to the container
            # instantiation, but the list is incomplete
            args, _, _, values = inspect.getargvalues(inspect.currentframe())
            super(GoodMixedTypeContainer, self).__init__({k: values[k] for k in args[1:]}) 

        def _validate(self):
            # Complete the instantiation
            self.tab1len = len(self.tab1)
            # NOTE: DataContainer does allow for tuples, but beware because
            # they have to saved to the fits files by converting them to strings
            # and writing them to the fits header.  So the tuples should be
            # short!  See _bundle below, and in DataContainer.
            self.arr1shape = self.arr1.shape

        def _bundle(self):
            # Bundle so there's only one Table and one Image per extension
            return [{'tab1len': self.tab1len, 'tab1': self.tab1},
                    {'arr1shape': str(self.arr1shape), 'arr1': self.arr1}]


    class BadMixedTypeContainer(GoodMixedTypeContainer):
        def _bundle(self):
            # Use default _bundle method, which will try to put both tables
            # in the same extension.  NOTE: Can't use super here because
            # GoodMixedTypeContainer doesn't have an 'ext' argument
            return DataContainer._bundle(self, ext='bad')

With this implementation:

    - To instantiate::

        x = np.arange(10)
        y = np.arange(10)+5
        z = np.arange(30).reshape(10,3)

        arr1 = np.full((3,3,3), -1)
        tab1 = Table(data=({'x':x,'y':y,'z':z}), meta={'test':'this'})

        data = GoodMixedTypeContainer(tab1, arr1)

    - Data access::

        print(data.tab1.keys())
        # ['x', 'y', 'z']
        print(assert data.tab1.meta['test'])
        # 'this'
        print(data.arr1shape)
        # (3,3,3)

    - Construct an `astropy.io.fits.HDUList`::

        hdu = data.to_hdu(add_primary=True)

        print(len(hdu))
        # 3: Includes the primary HDU, one with the table, and one with the array

        print([h.name for h in hdu])
        # ['PRIMARY', 'TAB1', 'ARR1']

    - Tuples are converted to strings::

        print(hdu['ARR1'].header['ARR1SHAPE'])
        # '(3,3,3)'

    - The tuples are converted back from strings when they're read
      from the HDU::

        _data = GoodMixedTypeContainer.from_hdu(hdu)
        print(_data.arr1shape)
        # (3,3,3)

    - Table metadata is also written to the header, which can be
      accessed with case-insensitive keys::

        print(hdu['TAB1'].header['TEST'])
        print(hdu['TAB1'].header['TesT'])
        # Both print: 'this'

    - However, it's important to note that the keyword case gets
      mangled when you read it back in. This has to do with the
      Table.read method and I'm not sure there's anything we can do
      about it without the help of the astropy folks. We recommend
      table metadata use keys that are in all caps::

        # Fails because of the string case
        print(_data.tab1.meta['test'])
        # This is okay
        print(_data.tab1.meta['TEST'])

    - The difference between the implementation of
      ``BadMixedTypeContainer`` and ``GoodMixedTypeContainer`` has to
      do with how the data is bundled into HDU extensions. The
      ``BadMixedTypeContainer`` will instantiate fine::

        data = BadMixedTypeContainer(tab1, arr1)
        print(data.tab1.keys())
        # ['x', 'y', 'z']
        print(data.tab1.meta['test'])
        # 'this'

    - But it will barf when you try to reformat/write the data
      because you can't write both a Table and an array to a single
      HDU::

        # Fails
        hdu = data.to_hdu()

Complex Instantiation Methods
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

All of the :class:`DataContainer` above have had simple instatiation
methods. :class:`DataContainer` can have more complex instantiation
methods, but there are significant limitations to keep in made.
Consider::

    class BadInitContainer(DataContainer):
        datamodel = {'inp1': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='Test'),
                     'inp2': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='test'),
                     'out': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='test'),
                     'alt': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='test')}

        def __init__(self, inp1, inp2, func='add'):
            args, _, _, values = inspect.getargvalues(inspect.currentframe())
            super(BadInitContainer, self).__init__({k: values[k] for k in args[1:]}) 


    class DubiousInitContainer(DataContainer):
        datamodel = {'inp1': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='Test'),
                     'inp2': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='test'),
                     'out': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='test'),
                     'alt': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='test')}

        def __init__(self, inp1, inp2, func='add'):
            # If any of the arguments of the init method aren't actually
            # part of the datamodel, you can't use the nominal two lines
            # used in all the other examples above.  You have to be specific
            # about what gets passed to super.__init__.  See the
            # BadInitContainer example above and the test below.  WARNING:
            # I'm not sure you would ever want to do this because it can
            # lead to I/O issues; see the _validate function.
            self.func = func
            super(DubiousInitContainer, self).__init__({'inp1': inp1, 'inp2':inp2})

        def _validate(self):
            # Because func isn't part of the data model, it won't be part of
            # self if the object is instantiated from a file.  So I have to
            # add it here.  But I don't know what the value of the attribute
            # was for the original object that was written to disk.  This is
            # why you likely always want anything that's critical to setting
            # up the object to be part of the datamodel so that it gets
            # written to disk.  See the testing examples for when this will
            # go haywire.
            if not hasattr(self, 'func'):
                self.func = None
            if self.func not in [None, 'add', 'sub']:
                raise ValueError('Function must be either \'add\' or \'sub\'.')

            # This is here because I don't want to overwrite something that
            # might have been read in from an HDU, particularly given that
            # func will be None if reading from a file!
            if self.out is None:
                print('Assigning out!')
                if self.func is None:
                    raise ValueError('Do not know how to construct out attribute!')
                self.out = self.inp1 + self.inp2 if self.func == 'add' else self.inp1 - self.inp2

        # I'm not going to overwrite _bundle, so that the nominal approach
        # is used.


    class ComplexInitContainer(DataContainer):
        datamodel = {'inp1': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='Test'),
                     'inp2': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='test'),
                     'out': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='test'),
                     'alt': dict(otype=np.ndarray, descr='test'),
                     'func': dict(otype=str, descr='test')}

        def __init__(self, inp1, inp2, func='add'):
            # Since func is part of the datamodel now, we can use the normal
            # two intantiation lines.
            args, _, _, values = inspect.getargvalues(inspect.currentframe())
            super(ComplexInitContainer, self).__init__({k: values[k] for k in args[1:]}) 

        def _validate(self):
            if self.func not in ['add', 'sub']:
                raise ValueError('Function must be either \'add\' or \'sub\'.')
            # This is here because I don't want to overwrite something that
            # might have been read in from an HDU, even though they should
            # nominally be the same!
            if self.out is None:
                print('Assigning out!')
                if self.func is None:
                    raise ValueError('Do not know how to construct out attribute!')
                self.out = self.inp1 + self.inp2 if self.func == 'add' else self.inp1 - self.inp2


With this implementation:

    - The instantiation of the ``BadInitContainer`` will fail because
      the init arguments all need to be part of the datamodel for it
      to work::

        x = np.arange(10)
        y = np.arange(10)+5

        data = BadInitContainer(x,y)
        # Fails with AttributeError

    - The following instantiation is fine because
      ``DubiousInitContainer`` handles the fact that some of the
      arguments to :func:`__init__` are not part of the datamodel::

        data = DubiousInitContainer(x,y)
        print(np.array_equal(data.out, data.inp1+data.inp2))
        # True

    - One component of the data model wasn't instantiated, so it will
      be None::
        
        print(data.alt is None)
        # True

    - The problem with ``DubiousInitContainer`` is that it has
      attributes that cannot be reinstantiated from what's written to
      disk. That is, :class:`DataContainers` aren't really fully
      formed objects unless all of its relevant attributes are
      components of the data model::

        _data = DubiousInitContainer.from_hdu(hdu)
        print(_data.func == DubiousInitContainer(x,y).func)
        # False
    
    - This is solved by adding func to the datamodel::
    
        data = ComplexInitContainer(x,y)
        _data = ComplexInitContainer.from_hdu(data.to_hdu(add_primary=True))
        print(data.func == _data.func)
        # True

    Provides the class data model. This is undefined in the abstract
    class and should be overwritten in the derived classes.

    The format of the ``datamodel`` needed for each implementation of
    a :class:`DataContainer` derived class is as follows.

    The datamodel itself is a class attribute (i.e., it is a member
    of the class, not just of an instance of the class). The
    datamodel is a dictionary of dictionaries: Each key of the
    datamodel dictionary provides the name of a given datamodel
    element, and the associated item (dictionary) for the datamodel
    element provides the type and description information for that
    datamodel element. For each datamodel element, the dictionary
    item must provide:

        - ``otype``: This is the type of the object for this
          datamodel item. E.g., for a float or a `numpy.ndarray`_,
          you would set ``otype=float`` and ``otype=np.ndarray``,
          respectively.

        - ``descr``: This provides a text description of the
          datamodel element. This is used to construct the datamodel
          tables in the pypeit documentation.

    If the object type is a `numpy.ndarray`_, you should also provide
    the ``atype`` keyword that sets the type of the data contained
    within the array. E.g., for a floating point array containing an
    image, your datamodel could be simply::

        datamodel = {'image' : dict(otype=np.ndarray, atype=float, descr='My image')}

    More advanced examples are given in the top-level module documentation.

    Currently, ``datamodel`` components are restricted to have
    ``otype`` that are :obj:`tuple`, :obj:`int`, :obj:`float`,
    ``numpy.integer``, ``numpy.floating``, `numpy.ndarray`_, or
    `astropy.table.Table`_ objects. E.g., ``datamodel`` values for
    ``otype`` *cannot* be :obj:`dict`.

        Certain **restrictions** apply to how the data can be bundled

        work correctly. These restriction are:

            - The shape and orientation of any input arrays are
              assumed to be correct.

            - Datamodel keys for arrays or `astropy.table.Table`_
              objects written to an HDU should match the HDU
              extension name. Otherwise, the set of HDU extension
              names and datamodel keys **must** be unique.

            - Datamodel keys will be matched to header values:
              :func:`to_hdu` will write any items in a dictionary
              that is an integer, float, or string (specific numpy
              types or otherwise) to the header. This means header
              keys in **all** extensions should be unique and should
              not be the same as any extension name.

            - Datamodels can contain tuples, but these must be
              reasonably converted to strings such they are included
              in (one of) the HDU header(s).

        Args:
            ext (:obj:`str`, optional):
                Name for the HDU extension. If None, no name is
                given.
            transpose_arrays (:obj:`bool`, optional):
                Transpose the arrays before writing them to the HDU.
                This option is mostly meant to correct orientation of

              make sure and/or test that this method doesn't meet

            - Because the `astropy.table.Table`_ methods are used

              also be included in the HDUs constructed by
              :func:`to_hdu`. However, the
              `astropy.table.Table.read`_ method always returns the

              keywords when the data is written, **they will be
              upper-case when read by this function**!
