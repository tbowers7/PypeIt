===============
History Keyword
===============

``PypeIt`` will update the ``HISTORY`` keyword in the FITS header with
information about how a file was created and what raw data the file was
reduced from.

Each history entry will start with a date in ISO 8601 format and the 
string ``PypeIt``. Because of the limited length allowed in the FITS
standard, entries may wrap to the next ``HISTORY`` keyword. To make it 
easier to detect if this has happened to a filename, all filenames are 
wrapped in double quotes ``"``.

Examples:
