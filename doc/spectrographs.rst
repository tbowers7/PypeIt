Spectrographs

Overview
========

Below we describe all of the spectrographs with existing code infrastructure
that enables ``PypeIt`` to reduce the data. Most of these spectrographs are
"supported," meaning that the reduction of the relevant data has been
well-vetted by ``PypeIt`` developers. "Unsupported" spectrographs are
in-development; however, the development timescale is undefined.

For instructions on how to add a new spectrograph see:
:doc:`new_spectrograph`.
