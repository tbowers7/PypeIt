Spec2D Output 
=============

.. index:: spec2d

Overview
========

During the data-reduction process, ``PypeIt`` creates a series of 2D
spectral images prior to extraction of 1D spectra. And, of course,
several of these 2D images may have greater value for analysis than
the 1D spectra.

For each on-source exposure, ``PypeIt`` outputs a series of these
images in a single, multi-extension fits file, separated by detector.
See the `Current Spec2DObj Data Model`_ for details.

Naming
======

The 2D spectra files have names like::

    spec2d_b27-J1217p3905_KASTb_2015May20T045733.560.fits

The model is::

    Prefix_frame-objname_spectrograph_timestamp.fits

Inspecting
==========

You can open this image in ds9 and play around. But we highly
recommend using the `pypeit_show_2dspec`_ script which interfaces
with `ginga`_.

.. _pypeit_show_2dspec:

pypeit_show_2dspec
------------------

This script displays the sky-subtracted 2D image for a single
detector in a `ginga`_ RC viewer. It also overlays the slits and any
objects extracted. It should be called from the reduction directory,
i.e. above the ``Science/`` folder where the spec2d image is located.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_show_2dspec.rst

Here is a typical call:

.. code-block:: console

    pypeit_show_2dspec Science/spec2d_c17_60L._LRISb_2017Mar20T055336.211.fits


This opens 4 tabs in the `ginga`_ display, one for each of the
following:

 - Procesed image (sciimg-det##)
 - Sky subtracted image (skysub-det##)
 - Sky residual image (sky_resid-det##)
 - Full residual image which removes the object too (resid-det##)

Red/green lines indicate slit edges.  Orange lines (if present)
indicate traces for detected objects. Light blue lines (if present)
indicate traces for manually extracted objects.

As you mouse around, the x-values shown at the bottom indicate
the wavelength.

pypeit_chk_2dslits
------------------

This script prints to the screen a short summary of the slit
information, detector by detector.

The script usage can be displayed by calling the script with the
``-h`` option:

.. include:: help/pypeit_chk_2dslits.rst


Identifying Slits
=================

If you need to generate an image describing the location of each
slit/order for a given detector here is the recommended approach::

    from pypeit import spec2dobj
    spec2DObj = spec2dobj.Spec2DObj.from_file('spec2d_b170320_2083-c17_60L._LRISb_2017Mar20T055336.211.fits', det=2)
    slitmask = spec2DObj.slits.slit_img(flexure=spec2DObj.sci_spat_flexure)

If no flexure correction was applied, it will be ignored.
This generates an image with pixel values:

 - -1 for a pixel not in any slit/order
 - SPAT_ID for each pixel in the slit identified by SPAT_ID

.. _spec2dobj_datamodel:

Current Spec2DObj Data Model
============================

Internally, the image is held in
:class:`~pypeit.spec2dobj.AllSpec2DObj`, which holds the full set of
:class:`~pypeit.spec2dobj.Spec2DObj` objects.

All wavelengths are in vacuum.

The data model for the latter is:

.. include:: include/datamodel_spec2dobj.rst

Each array and the associated
:class:`~pypeit.images.detector_container.DetectorContainer` is
written as a separate HDU prefixed by the detector number,
``DET01-``.

For a description of how to use the bitmasks (i.e., the ``*BPMMASK``
extensions), see our description of the :ref:`out_masks`.
